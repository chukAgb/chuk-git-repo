# Program to find the multiplication and division of two numbers

# Ask the user for input
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number = "))
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number = "))

# Perform multiplication
multiplication = num1 * num2

# Display the results
print("The product of the two numbers is = ", multiplication)

# Perform division
# Avoiding division by zero, add condition
if num2 !=0:
	division = num1/num2
else:
 	division = "(cannot divide by zero)"

# Display the results
print("The division of the two numbers is = ", division)
